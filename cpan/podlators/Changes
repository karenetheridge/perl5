                      User-Visible podlators Changes

podlators 4.03 (2015-12-06)

    Fix tests when POD_MAN_DATE or SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH are already set in
    the environment.  Thanks, Niko Tyni.  (Debian Bug#807086)

    Continue general improvements and refactoring of the test suite to
    make it more maintainable and clean out duplicate or unnecessary code.

podlators 4.02 (2015-12-02)

    For versions of Perl prior to 5.11, install the modules into the Perl
    core module directories, since in those versions site modules did not
    take precedence over Perl core modules.  Thanks, Peter Rabbitson.
    (#110024)

podlators 4.01 (2015-12-01)

    [Pod::Text::Termcap] Do not override the TERMPATH environment variable
    if it's already set.  This should fix the test suite with Term::Cap
    1.16 (which has a bug in termcap handling if TERMPATH doesn't point to
    a valid file).  Also document the manipulation of TERMPATH.

    Revert the switch to Module::Build as the build system.  This creates
    a circular dependency with Module::Build, since it wants a newer
    version of Pod::Man than in Perl versions prior to 5.10.1.  Instead,
    add the new metadata to Makefile.PL and stick with a single build
    system that will also work inside Perl core.

podlators 4.00 (2015-11-28)

    Increase the version number of the package to be larger than any of
    the previous version numbers of any of the modules, and change all
    modules to use the same version as the overall podlators package.
    Switch to a simple decimal version number to avoid complexity with
    v-strings and portability to old versions of Perl.

    podlators now requires Perl 5.006 or later.  All modules enable
    warnings.  Please report any unexpected or confusing warnings as bugs
    in the bug tracker.

    [pod2man] In previous versions, the -r or --release option could be
    specified without an argument and was interpreted as setting that
    value to the empty string.  That never made a great deal of sense, and
    the original change to Perl was apparently because no one realized one
    could pass the empty string as the argument value.  The argument is
    now mandatory, but may be the empty string, which will cause some
    *roff implementations to use the system default.

    Allow any even number of characters to be specified as the quote marks
    for Pod::Text and Pod::Man (and the corresponding --quotes options of
    pod2text and pod2man), rather than being artificially limited to one-
    or two-character quotes.  The first half of the string will be used as
    the left quote and the second half as the right quote.  This allows
    Unicode characters or groff escapes like \(lq and \(rq to be used.
    (Partly addresses #103298)

    [Pod::Man] Attempt to detect if the input came from a pipe and
    therefore has a completely unhelpful (and nonreproducible) source file
    name, and diagnose this as an error.  Document that the name option
    (--name to pod2man) is required when processing POD source from
    standard input.  (Debian Bug#777405)

    [Pod::Man] Honor the environment variable SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH and use it
    as the timestamp from which to derive the left-hand footer if the date
    option is not set, overriding the timestamp of the input file.  This
    is primarily useful to ensure reproducible builds of the same output
    file given the same souce and Pod::Man version, even when file
    timestamps may not be consistent.  Thanks, Niko Tyni.  (Debian
    Bug#801621)

    [Pod::Man] Honor the environment variable POD_MAN_DATE and use its
    contents, if set, as the value of the left-hand footer if the date
    option is not set, overriding the timestamp of the input file.  This
    was an earlier version of SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, but has been supported in
    Debian for a while and doesn't serve exactly the same purpose, so both
    continue to be supported.  Thanks, Niko Tyni.

    [Pod::Man] The default left-hand footer date is now based on UTC
    rather than the local time zone to make the output more reproducible.
    Thanks, Chris Lamb.  (Debian Bug#780259)

    [Pod::Man] Simplify the preamble code for handling the F register and
    index entries, and add backslashes after the braces in the preamble
    code for handling the F register to avoid introducing a spurious page
    break before at the first page with AT&T *roff.  Thanks, Carsten
    Kunze and Daphne Pfister.  (#92979)

    [Pod::Man] Support setting the left-hand footer to the empty string.

    Fix documentation of the utf8 option to Pod::Man and Pod::Text, and
    the corresponding -u option to pod2man and pod2text, to reflect that
    Pod::Simple now autodetects Latin-1 and UTF-8 but warns.

    More clearly document the options that set values in the .TH header in
    the pod2man and Pod::Man documentation.  Thanks, Guillem Jover.
    (#103297)

    [Pod::Text] Fix encoding handling in documents that start without an
    encoding declaration and then declare an encoding partway through.
    Previously, this would result in attempts to print wide characters if
    there were non-ASCII characters in the document.  Thanks, Magnolia K.
    (#101722)

    [Pod::Text] Change the documentation to not say Pod::Text only
    generates ASCII text.  (#89355)

    Switch the preferred module build system to Module::Build, but still
    provide a Makefile.PL file for backward compatibility and for the use
    of Perl core.  (#108714)

    Installation of this package no longer tries to overwrite the Pod::Man
    and Pod::Text modules that come with Perl core, and instead relies on
    the normal precedence rules in Perl's module search path that prefer
    locally-installed modules over core modules.

    Rename NEWS to Changes to match the normal Perl convention.

    Work around a bug in Term::Cap 1.16 that caused the test suite to fail
    by forcing a setting of TERMPATH to a termcap file provided by the
    test suite while running tests.  (#98272)

podlators 2.5.3 (2013-10-05)

    Fix documentation of the default for the errors constructor parameter.

    Skip the empty text and man page errors tests if Pod::Simple didn't
    produce any errors, which happens with the version shipped with Perl
    versions prior to 5.18.  Catch warnings as well as exceptions in these
    tests.

podlators 2.5.2 (2013-09-22)

    The parse_lines and parse_string_document methods in Pod::Man and
    Pod::Text now set a default output file handle of STDOUT if none was
    set.

    Perform document initialization even if the document is contentless.
    Documents with only errors are shown as contentless but then have a
    POD ERRORS section, and previously this led to internal errors because
    state variables weren't properly initialized.  Thanks, Andreas Koenig.
    (#88724)

    Apply various optimization improvements from Dagfinn Ilmari Manns√•ker.
    There should be no changes in the output.  (#83253)

    Fix an erroneous output_fh reference in the Pod::Man documentation.
    Thanks, Andreas Koenig.  (#88723)

    Fix various comment typos.  Thanks, David Steinbrunner.  (#85683)

    In perlpodstyle, wrap verbatim license line in POD that was over 79
    characters after the man page indentation.  Thanks, Brian Gottreu and
    Steve Hay.  (#87440)

podlators 2.5.1 (2013-02-27)

    Adjust the tag width tests and the list handling tests to avoid
    spurious warnings from Pod::Simple about mismatched =item types.

podlators 2.5.0 (2013-01-02)

    Support a new errors option in Pod::Man and Pod::Text.  Valid values
    are die, stderr, pod, and none.  Convert the stderr option to the
    errors option with value stderr.  Add the corresponding --errors
    option to pod2man and pod2text.  (#39007)

    Add a new nourls option to Pod::Man and Pod::Text to suppress the URL
    from L<> formatting codes that contain anchor text, and add the
    corresponding --nourls option to pod2man and pod2text.  (#62210)

    [Pod::Man] Extend a small-caps section through the punctuation that
    commonly appears in license disclaimers so that small caps isn't
    turned on and off at the boundaries of every word, producing
    unreadable *roff.

    [Pod::Man] Collapse consecutive whitespace and remove newlines in
    index term text.  Thanks, Kevin Ryde.  (#82332)

podlators 2.4.2 (2012-06-01)

    Remove the test of a POD document without an encoding.  We previously
    tested that this interpreted the document as ISO 8859-1, but
    Pod::Simple behavior has changed so that the test started failing,
    plus Pod::Simple now warns about a missing =encoding.  (#77553)

podlators 2.4.1 (2012-05-30)

    Fix detection of PerlIO UTF-8 handling by requesting details on PerlIO
    layers to look for the UTF8 flag, which is not a layer in its own
    right.  Thanks, Leon Timmermans.  (#76440)

    [Pod::Man] Fix handling of the F register when processing multiple
    documents at once.  .IX will now continue to be defined for documents
    after the first, and the page number will not be reset at the start of
    each document.  Thanks to Nicholas Clark for the analysis.  (perl
    #103202)

    In the pod2man and pod2text driver scripts, report an error and remove
    the empty output file if the input file had no content (if it did not
    exist, for example).  Exit with non-zero status if there were any
    errors.  Track contentless status inside Pod::Man and Pod::Text.
    Thanks, Dmitry Smirnov.  (#75099)

    Override parse_file in Pod::Man and Pod::Text to set output_fh to
    STDOUT if it is not already set.  (#77530)

    [Pod::Man] Format the URL text before comparing it to the anchor when
    deciding whether to show separate anchor text.  This avoids spurious
    mismatches between the URL target and anchor text because the anchor
    text was already formatted and has (for example) hyphens escaped.
    (#76396)

    [Pod::Man] Define \*(C` and \*(C' to the empty string when processed
    through troff to avoid groff warnings.  Avoid warnings from checking
    the F register (used to enable index output) when running under groff.
    Patch from Bjarni Ingi Gislason.  (#75434)

    [Pod::Man] Fix the ASCII fallback string for the AE ligature to use
    the string that was actually defined.

    Stop removing pod2man and pod2text on make realclean, left over from
    when they were generated from *.PL scripts.  (#74848)

    Embed the PID in file names generated by the test suite to avoid
    conflicts when running the test suite in parallel.  (#62083)

podlators 2.4.0 (2010-10-10)

    Switch UTF-8 output encoding to use Encode directly instead of adding
    a PerlIO layer.  Probe the PerlIO layers with protection for Perl
    versions without PerlIO and set a flag indicating whether we also need
    to encode, to avoid double-encoding when writing to a file handle that
    is already doing UTF-8 encoding via PerlIO.

    [Pod::Man] Do not strip escaped trailing whitespace such as that
    created by S<> at the end of a line, since the backslash is then taken
    by *roff as escaping the newline.  Thanks, Kevin Ryde.  (#61781)

    Add perlpodstyle, a new style guide for POD documentation, split
    mostly from the NOTES section of the pod2man man page.  Remove the
    NOTES section of pod2man's documentation.

    Convert pod2man and pod2text from scripts generated from *.PL files to
    simple scripts, relying on ExtUtils::MakeMaker to handle replacing the
    #! path during the package build.

podlators 2.3.1 (2010-02-17)

    Increase $VERSION in Pod::Text::Color and Pod::Text::Termcap, missed
    in the previous release.

podlators 2.3.0 (2009-12-28)

    Support anchor text for L<> links of type URL by rendering the anchor
    text and then the URL in angle brackets.  Now requires Pod::Simple
    3.06 or later.

    [Pod::Text] When formatting item tags, use the width of the tag
    without formatting codes.  This fixes formatting issues with
    Pod::Text::Color, Pod::Text::Termcap, and Pod::Text::Overstrike.

    [Pod::Man] Suppress all formatting in the NAME section to avoid
    confusing lexgrog and fix mishandling of C<> markup in NAME.  Clarify
    in the pod2man documentation that no markup should be used in the NAME
    section of a manual page.  Thanks, Niko Tyni.

    [Pod::Man] Escape backslashes in the quoted text of .IX macros
    generated from X<> formatting code.

    [Pod::Man] Avoid using POSIX::strftime because POSIX requires Fcntl,
    which is an XS module, and hence can't build in miniperl.  This allows
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker to build as a normal module in Perl core.  Thanks,
    Michael G Schwern.

    [Pod::ParseLink] Allow anchor text for URLs.  Fix the check of the
    anchor text to not think no text was provided when the text was "0".

    Remove the temporary files created by the test suite in a loop to
    ensure that all versions are deleted on VMS.  Thanks, John
    E. Malmberg.

    Convert the test suite to Test::More.

podlators 2.2.2 (2009-01-17)

    [Pod::Text] Correctly handle indentation of verbatim paragraphs that
    contain lines with only whitespace.  Thanks, Renee Baecker.

podlators 2.2.1 (2008-12-19)

    [Pod::Text] In the legacy pod2text method, properly initialize the
    output file handle when called with only one argument.  Thanks,
    Michael G Schwern.

    Fix the t/text-encoding.t test on Windows by setting raw encoding on
    the output file handle.  Thanks, Steve Hay.

podlators 2.2.0 (2008-10-05)

    [Pod::Text] Try to preserve the previous behavior of setting the
    output encoding to match the input encoding if utf8 is not set, but
    support forcing an output encoding of utf8 with the utf8 option.  Add
    a corresponding --utf8 option to pod2text.  Document the PerlIO
    limitations of the current utf8 support.

    Quote all module version numbers to preserve any trailing zeroes.

    Skip spelling tests unless RRA_MAINTAINER_TESTS is set in the
    environment.  Spelling dictionaries are too different between systems.

podlators 2.1.4 (2008-09-21)

    Support aspell as a spell checker for spelling tests.

    Skip UTF-8 tests for versions of Perl prior to 5.8.

podlators 2.1.3 (2008-09-14)

    Add a stderr option to Pod::Man and Pod::Text that sends POD errors to
    standard error instead of adding a POD ERRORS section to the generated
    documentation.  Add a corresponding --stderr option to pod2man and
    pod2text.

    [Pod::Man] Stop remapping the code point for non-breaking space.  This
    should not be necessary and was wrong when the string from Pod::Simple
    was a character string and not a byte string.  It was papering over a
    bug in setting the encoding of an input POD file.

    In the test suite, properly set encoding on file descriptors so that
    the UTF-8 tests are handled with the correct encoding.  Test that
    non-breaking spaces don't interfere with hyphen detection.

podlators 2.1.2 (2008-07-20)

    [Pod::Man] Use .SS instead of a local .Sh macro for subheadings, and
    stop defining .Sh.

    [Pod::Man] Remap ISO 8850-1 non-breaking spaces produced by
    Pod::Simple to the corresponding UTF-8 code point for UTF-8 output.

    Add a test for spelling and fix multiple spelling and markup errors.

podlators 2.1.1 (2008-07-03)

    [Pod::Man] Do not include the accent mark definitions in generated
    *roff if the output is in UTF-8.

    Fix the test for S<> handling with all whitespace to not give a
    spurious failure with Pod::Simple 3.06.

podlators 2.1.0 (2008-06-01)

    Add a new utf8 option to Pod::Man.  If set, do not convert non-ASCII
    characters to *roff escapes or X, and instead output literal UTF-8
    characters.  Add a new --utf8 option to pod2man.

    [Pod::Man] Match text between \f(CW and \fP or \fR in headings
    non-greedily to get the fonts right with multiple C<> formatting
    codes.

    [Pod::Man] Protect .Sh text against leading *roff control characters
    since some *roff implementations apparently "look through" font
    escapes at the beginning of lines.

    [Pod::Man] Escape backslashes separately from processing non-ASCII
    characters and do that, dash escaping, and underscore adjustment
    before processing non-ASCII characters.  Otherwise, we escape the
    hyphen in eth characters.

podlators 2.0.6 (2007-11-28)

    [Pod::Man] Escape apostrophes and backquotes in verbatim and C<> text.

    [Pod::Man] Define the IX macro to empty rather than leaving it
    undefined when indexing is not requested to eliminate warnings when
    groff warnings are enabled.

    [Pod::Man] Simplify the logic to skip lib directories to avoid Perl
    warnings and unnecessary checks.

podlators 2.0.5 (2006-09-16)

    Accept and mostly ignore a hash of options as the first option to
    parse_from_file.  Support an option of -cutting and configure
    Pod::Simple to assume the POD has already started.  This is for
    backward compatibility with Pod::Parser.

    [Pod::Man] Recognize more uses of hyphens in regular English text and
    allow them to be regular hyphens.

    [Pod::Man] Turn off hyphenation and, for nroff, justification after
    the .TH macro since that's where groff turns them on.

    [Pod::Man] Stop mapping vertical bar to \(bv, since it produces
    Unicode characters where they aren't desirable.  Remove the preamble
    reference to the Tr string, which was never defined.

podlators 2.0.4 (2006-02-19)

    [Pod::Man] Pod::Simple's source_filename method returns garbage if
    we're parsing from a file handle, so use the current time if stating
    the returned input file fails.

    Add parse_from_filehandle methods to Pod::Man and Pod::Text for
    backward compatibility with the earlier versions based on Pod::Parser.

podlators 2.0.3 (2006-01-28)

    In the test suite, pass in a file handle for Pod::Simple output and
    then close it afterwards.  This works around Pod::Simple leaving file
    handles open and preventing removal of temporary files on Windows.
    This is temporary until a new Pod::Simple release offers a better
    approach.

podlators 2.0.2 (2006-01-25)

    In the parse_from_file method, flush the output file handle rather
    than closing it.  Closing it is unexpected and could break callers.

    In Pod::Text::Termcap and Pod::Text::Color, Use additional temporary
    variables to avoid ${char}{0,$width}, which only works in very recent
    Perls.

    Fix man test that needs an ISO 8859-1 encoding.

podlators 2.0.1 (2006-01-20)

    Call reinit before calling the Pod::Simple parse_from_file method to
    preserve the previous capability of reusing the same Pod::Man object
    for multiple documents.  Close the output file handle after
    Pod::Simple returns to force the output to flush.

    [Pod::Text] The legacy pod2text method was broken because
    Pod::Simple's parse_file method only takes one argument.  Pass the
    second argument to output_fh instead.

    Fix portability issues with Perl 5.005.

    Use a single object for all conversions in pod2man and pod2text for a
    minor speedup.

podlators 2.00 (2005-11-28)

    Rewrite all modules and driver scripts to use Pod::Simple instead of
    Pod::Parser.  The output should be identical except that C<> with no
    content outputs quotes for Pod::Text-based parsers, E<> handling is
    improved, and various small bugs have been fixed.  Thanks, Sean Burke.

    [pod2man] Create a new parser for each file since Pod::Simple parsers
    are not reusable.

    [pod2text] Add support for multiple pairs of input and output files,
    similar to pod2man.

    [Pod::Man] Strip vendor_perl as well as site_perl when determining the
    man page title.  Thanks, Alexey Tourbin.

    Fall back on fullstop_space_harden if preserve_whitespace is not
    available, for compatibility with older Pod::Simple.

    Count text lengths correctly when wrapping in Pod::Text::Color and
    Pod::Text::Termcap when there are multiple adjacent escape sequences.
    Use a temporary variable to make the regex clearer.

    Change section ordering in some documentation following perl5-porters
    discussion.

    Remove obsolete documentation caution against enclosing URLs in L<>.

    Force a particular terminal configuration to get reliable results in
    the Pod::Text::Termcap test suite.

    Enhance the test suite substantially with additional tests from Sean
    Burke.

podlators 1.27 (2003-07-09)

    [Pod::Text::Termcap] Handle the case where the HOME environment
    variable isn't set, mostly for Windows.

podlators 1.26 (2003-03-30)

    [Pod::Man] Make sure the module returns 1 to keep Perl 5.8.0 happy.

podlators 1.25 (2003-01-04)

    [Pod::Man] Track the type of items in an =over list and only map
    asterisk to a real bullet if the item type is bullet.  Fix a bug where
    =item 0 was treated the same as =item with no tag.

podlators 1.24 (2002-08-03)

    Support a margin option in Pod::Text and use it to set the initial
    indentation level.  Fix handling of the colon in the margin when the
    alt format is enabled.  Add a new -m option to pod2text to set the
    margin.

podlators 1.23 (2002-07-14)

    Clean up some old-style L<> links in pod2text that were workarounds
    for fixed bugs in Pod::Man and Pod::Text.

    Add a pointer to the module web site in the documentation.

podlators 1.22 (2002-06-23)

    Tweak the regex for matching numbers in C<> to not consider a single
    period to be a number, which affects whether surrounding quotes are
    added.

podlators 1.21 (2002-02-16)

    [Pod::Text::Overstrike] Fix the regex for wrapping lines to use a
    non-backtracking section for each character to avoid exponential
    backtracking on lines with a lot of markup.

podlators 1.20 (2002-01-27)

    [Pod::Text::Overstrike] Use [\b] instead of \cH in regexes to match
    backspaces, for platforms that use EBCDIC where \b and \cH aren't the
    same character.

podlators 1.19 (2002-01-02)

    [Pod::Man] Do not apply guesswork to the text inside the NAME section,
    since it may confuse programs like catman.  Do not output .UC after
    the .TH macro.  catman doesn't like anything between the NAME section
    and .TH, and .UC doesn't appear to actually do anything on any modern
    platform.

    [Pod::Man] Correctly handle a verbatim paragraph right before a
    heading.

    [Pod::Text] Fix error reporting for unknown sequences and unknown
    commands to be more consistent and update the documentation to match.

    [Pod::Text::Termcap] Terminal speed should be a number, not a string.
    Also fall back on a hard-coded terminal speed if getospeed doesn't
    work.

podlators 1.18 (2001-11-30)

    [Pod::Text::Termcap] Fall back on a hard-coded terminal speed if
    POSIX::Termios doesn't work, such as on VMS.

    [Pod::ParseLink] Escape L<> in the NAME section of the documentation.

podlators 1.17 (2001-11-27)

    [Pod::Man] Return references to arrays rather than references to
    scalars for already-formatted text.  There are too many odd bugs with
    scalar references in older versions of Perl.  No longer bless
    references since the current Pod::Parser doesn't require it.  Now
    requires Pod::Parser 1.13 or later.

    Change all documentation references from interior sequences to
    formatting codes to match the terminology of perlpodspec.

    [Pod::Text::Termcap] Fix an incorrect heading in the documentation.

podlators 1.16 (2001-11-26)

    Use an @INC path of ../lib and a new function to find source files for
    when the module test suite is being run as part of the Perl core
    tests.

podlators 1.15 (2001-11-26)

    [Pod::Text::Termcap] Wrap the call to Term::Cap with eval because it
    throws exceptions if the terminal can't be found.  Fall back on the
    ANSI escape sequences rather than dying if the termcap entry is
    incomplete.  Note the fallback in the documentation.

    Delete the lax option in pod2man before calling Pod::Man and document
    that it is obsolete and podchecker should be used instead.

    Improve the pod2man and Pod::Man documentation to refer to podchecker,
    add discussion of guesswork and 8-bit character handling, and mention
    the fragility of the heuristics.

podlators 1.14 (2001-11-23)

    [Pod::Text::Overstrike] Interpolate before formatting to prevent the
    formatting codes from ending up in the output, and strip any existing
    formatting before applying new formatting.

    [Pod::Man] Use font escapes rather than .I to avoid strange problems
    with quoting, at least for =head3.  =head1 and =head2 likely still
    have troubles with repeated double-quotes.  Fix all fixed-width font
    changes for nroff, not just the simple ones, and don't hard-code the
    value of any fixed-width font.

    [Pod::Man] Improve and simplify the handling of indentation shifts.

    [Pod::Man] When intuiting the man page name for a module, also strip
    $^O by itself as a directory component even when not preceeded or
    followed by a dash and other text.

    [Pod::Text] Fix handling of =for or =begin/=end in =item paragraphs.
    Default to a tag of "*" if none is given.  Insert some whitespace for
    empty item paragraphs to keep them from blending into subsequent text.

    [Pod::ParseLink] Fix a bug in the handling of link text that's
    entirely in quotes.  Double quotes are now only removed around
    sections, not names.  Text enclosed entirely in double quotes is
    interpreted as a link to a section.

    Fix various -w warnings.

podlators 1.13 (2001-11-15)

    Fix -w warnings with hyphen handling.

podlators 1.12 (2001-11-15)

    Add a new module, Pod::ParseLink, to parse the contents of an L<>
    sequence.  Use it everywhere.  Defer expansion of formatting escapes
    inside L<> until after L<> is processed.  Surround URLs with angle
    brackets in the output.

    Remove the special handling of consecutive L</section> links.

    Support E<apos>, E<nbsp>, and E<shy>.

    [Pod::Man] Completely rewrite the name parsing code for modules to use
    File::Spec.  In the process, fix a bug in dealing with the new
    three-component version number directories.  Swap the order of date
    and release in the .TH line to better comply with the man macro
    documentation.

    [Pod::Man] Rewrite the handling of dashes and hyphens.  Be much more
    conservative about which hyphens are turned into dashes, and make all
    hyphens non-breaking unless we can be fairly sure that they're inside
    normal words.

    [Pod::Man] Handle indentation of =item-less =over/=back blocks.

    [Pod::Man] Include the version of Pod::Parser in the header.

    [Pod::Man] Only try to determine a module name from the path for the
    man page name if the man page we're generating is in section 3.

    [Pod::Man] No longer insert a timestamp into the generated man page;
    it just causes unnecessary differences and merge conflicts.

    [Pod::Text] Inside S<>, convert all whitespace to non-breaking spaces,
    not just spaces.

    Add the --name option to pod2man and document the name option in
    Pod::Man.

    [Pod::Man] Use L<> for all man page references in the documentation
    that should be highlighted.  Switch the rest to bold versions of the
    program name.  Change func(n) to func(3) in the example of things that
    are automatically formatted so that it will be formatted.  Remove from
    BUGS the note that some of the path mangling assumes Unix directory
    separators.  Don't give anchor text for L<> links that no longer
    require it.

    Update the documentation in Pod::Text and subclasses to use
    now-allowable POD constructs like C<< >>.  Don't escape angle brackets
    that don't require escaping.  Don't give anchor text for L<> links
    that no longer require it.

podlators 1.11 (2001-10-20)

    Add the code option to Pod::Text to include the non-POD text of the
    input file and document it.  Add the corresponding --code flag to
    pod2text.

    Converted warnings for unknown escapes, unknown sequences, and
    unmatched =back into warnings from carps and include the file and line
    number of the POD data instead of the Perl code.

    [Pod::Text::Overstrike] Better handle the case where a highlighted
    portion of text ends a line.

    Add --verbose flag to pod2man to print out each output file as it is
    generated.

    [Pod::Man] Fix *roff syntax error from using .if with .el during quote
    handling.

    [Pod::Man] Fix output for X<> sequences.

podlators 1.10 (2001-07-10)

    Add heuristics to decide whether to quote the argument of C<>.

    [Pod::Man] Remove font changes for nroff with C<> to work around a bug
    in the Solaris 2.6 version of nroff's handling of \fP in headings.  No
    longer add an extra level of quoting for =item; it isn't necessary.

    [Pod::Man] Remove the logic turning PI into a pretty pi character.  It
    produces too many false positives.

    [Pod::Man] Remove the definition .Ip from the preamble.  Remove .bd B
    3 from the preamble; this isn't part of the accent mark definitions
    but instead changes the way bolding is done, confusing some other
    translators.  Use .IP instead of .Ip everywhere.

    In the POD style section of pod2man, add a description of the
    COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE section, add a mention of a mailing list in SEE
    ALSO, and mention that large logs are better kept separate from
    HISTORY in the description of a standard manual page.

    Standardize on COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE for licensing information across
    all of the package documentation.

podlators 1.09 (2001-04-09)

    [Pod::Man] Fine-tune formatting guesswork.  Don't allow colons after
    sequences to put in small caps since they're already handled by being
    rolled into the sequence and were causing weird things to happen in
    references to functions.  Allow small caps before an open paren.
    Teach the handling of functions and manual page references about small
    caps escapes, and be pickier about what constitutes a manual page
    reference.

    [Pod::Text] Fix again the incorrect mappings for E<Iacute> and
    E<iacute>, and this time for E<Igrave> and E<igrave> too.  Thanks,
    Sean Burke.

podlators 1.08 (2001-02-09)

    Output anything that looks like a URL verbatim rather than
    interpreting it as a manual page reference.

podlators 1.07 (2001-01-16)

    [Pod::Man] Remove newlines from heading contents.

    [Pod::Man] Quote the file name in the man page header if it contains
    spaces.

podlators 1.06 (2000-12-25)

    New Pod::Text::Overstrike contributed by Joe Smith.  Add -o or
    --overstrike to pod2text to use it for formatting.

    [Pod::Man] =item text requires another level of quoting of double
    quotes, which was already present but not working for C<> text because
    it was in the wrong order.  Fix.

podlators 1.05 (2000-11-18)

    Change the default quote character for C<> to be double quotes rather
    than matched left/right single quotes.

    Add support for =head3 and =head4.

    Allow pod2man to take multiple pairs of input and output files on the
    command line to decrease the time that it takes to process all of
    Perl's documentation.

    [Pod::Man] Switch \*C` and \*C' sequences from C<> as well as literal
    double-quotes if the quote character contains double quotes.  Not
    doing this was causing weird output on some systems in some
    circumstances.  Use a separate quote mapping function for text blocks
    to work around a Solaris 2.6 nroff bug.

    [Pod::Man] Use \fP to switch back to the default font rather than
    changing back to \fR so that font changes work correctly in headings
    using a different font.  Sprinkle \fP through all font changes so that
    the default font is always the "previous" font so that the above
    works.

podlators 1.04 (2000-10-09)

    [Pod::Man] Output .PD 0 and .PD around repeated =item tags so that
    they're formatted without intervening blank lines, improving
    formatting of, e.g., perlfunc.pod.

    [Pod::Text] Fix incorrect mappings for E<Iacute> and E<iacute>.
    Thanks, Sean Burke.

podlators 1.03 (2000-09-03)

    Support configuration of what quote characters to use around C<>
    text.  Add a new --quotes option to pod2man and pod2text.

    Report nicer errors when encountering an unknown paragraph command.

    Add support for E<sol> and E<verbar>.

    [Pod::Man] Fix the regex for stripping bullets from index entries so
    that it doesn't strip a leading "o".

    [Pod::Man] In the prelude, terminate the .IX definition with ".."
    instead of ".    ." for groff.

    [Pod::Text] The pod2text method, when given two arguments, was
    incorrectly assigning to $_[0], causing other sane problems.  Fix.

podlators 1.02 (2000-04-25)

    [Pod::Man] Fix hyphens and underscores only in literal C<> content,
    fixing mangling of hyphens and underscores that are the result of
    other sequence processing.

podlators 1.01 (2000-03-30)

    Install the modules in the Perl core area if the Perl version is 5.6.0
    or higher.

    [Pod::Man] Strip a leading lib/ from a file name for module man pages,
    needed for ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

podlators 1.00 (2000-03-16)

    This has now been incorporated into Perl core as pod2man and pod2text.
    Rename pod2roff to pod2man accordingly.

    Hide "-" arguments to the driver scripts from Getopt::Long so that
    Pod::Parser will interpret them as STDIN or STDOUT.

    [Pod::Man] Protect any line that starts with a backlash and leading
    periods following font escapes.  Replace embedded newlines in titles
    with spaces.

    [Pod::Man] Use "perl v5.6.0" instead of "perl 5.6, patch 0" for the
    default release string, handle both pre-5.6 and post-5.6 version
    numbering schemes.  Zero-pad the month and day in the modification
    date.  Avoid warnings when center, date, or release aren't set.

    [Pod::Man] Allow for two-character fonts.

    [Pod::Man] Work around a Perl 5.6 bug affecting L<> text generation.
    Fix Z<> handling with current Perl.

    [Pod::Man] Make filename munging safe even when $* is set and the
    filenames contain embedded newlines.

    [Pod::Man] Fix the regex to concatenate multiple L<> section links and
    fix whitespace handling for it around "and".

    [Pod::Text] Add the remaining ISO 8859-1 HTML entities.  Thanks, Tim
    Jenness.

    [pod2man] Change Getopt::Long config from bundling to
    bundling_override so that options like -center work for backwards
    compatibility.

    [pod2text] Don't default to Pod::Text::Termcap even if STDOUT is a tty
    until it works right on Windows, VMS, etc.

podlators 0.08 (1999-10-07)

    Add support for numeric E<> escapes.

    [Pod::Man] Fix doubled quotes in links to sections.

    [Pod::Text] Export pod2text for backwards compatibility.

    [pod2roff] Fix argument passing to Pod::Parser to use an expanded hash
    instead of a hash reference.

podlators 0.07 (1999-09-25)

    [Pod::Man] Change the parsing model so that, rather than deferring E<>
    escapes until just before output, *roff output is generated by the
    interior sequence parsing and the result is passed up the parse trees
    as Pod::Man::String objects instead of scalars to mark the output as
    already processed.  In the process, clean up what *roff escaping and
    guesswork is applied where, and clean up the whole process of applying
    guesswork.  Improve the escaping of dashes and hyphens to use a single
    pass.

    [Pod::Man] Improve the small caps guesswork to allow for more cases,
    including several adjacent all caps words.

    [Pod::Man] Fix some bugs with the link text generation for man page
    references.

    [Pod::Man] Improve the index generation slightly.

    [Pod::Man] Fix several places that were clobbering the caller's $_.

podlators 0.06 (1999-09-20)

    Add pod2roff and Pod::Man, which convert POD to man pages.

    Rename pod2txt to pod2text and Pod::PlainText to Pod::Text.

    [Pod::Text] =begin text blocks are now output verbatim rather than
    interpreted as POD.

    [Pod::Text] Document the oddity with Ctrl-As as a restriction.

    [Pod::Text] Always treat =for paragraphs as verbatim text.

    [Pod::Text::Color] Add a BUGS note that the implementation is rather
    incomplete, and document the reliance on Term::ANSIColor.

    [pod2text] Add an explicit check for Term::ANSIColor if -c was given.

    [Pod::Man] Add a BUGS entry for index entries for stuff in NAME.

    [Pod::Text] Document two more diagnostics and a cross-reference to
    pod2text.

    [pod2text] Add documentation of -h and expand the DIAGNOSTICS section
    to include directly-generated error messages and the most common
    Getopt::Long message.

podlators 0.05 (1999-09-18)

    [Pod::Text::Color] Rename Pod::SimpleText to Pod::PlainText in one
    more place in the documentation.

podlators 0.04 (1999-08-30)

    Use File::Spec during the build to build file paths for portability,
    and remove the dist setting since current Perls get this right.

    Fix the #! line in pod2txt during the build.

podlators 0.03 (1999-08-30)

    Rename Pod::SimpleText to Pod::PlainText.

    [pod2txt] Document that Pod::Text::Termcap is used by default if
    STDOUT is a tty.  Clarify the documentation of --loose.

podlators 0.02 (1999-07-29)

    Rename the package itself from Pod::SimpleText to podlators.

    [Pod::SimpleText] Add a pod2text function for backwards compatibility.

    [Pod::SimpleText] Properly wrap multiline =item tags.

    [Pod::SimpleText] Fix a spurious space with =for text commands.

    [Pod::SimpleText] Check the content of sequences against the empty
    string specifically rather than testing truth so that it does the
    right thing with 0.

    [Pod::SimpleText] Process sequences for =head headings.

podlators 0.01 (1999-06-12)

    Initial release with pod2txt and Pod::SimpleText.
